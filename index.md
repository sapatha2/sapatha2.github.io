If you want to know about my scientific credentials, take a peek at my bio. Otherwise, I post frequently with details about my work day-to-day after having completed my PhD in computational and theoretical condensed matter physics. The posts are highly technical and I am not intending to be non-technical. Hopefully this helps grad students or people looking to be a theoretical/computational physicist get a grasp on what we do after our PhDs.
