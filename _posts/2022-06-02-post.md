I was working on editing a paper today, you can take a peek below at the amount of edits I do. 
This is primarily my own writing, so im going to forward this to all my friends who complain about me nitpicking their papers.
The paper is nearly done at this point, and we're going to push it to submission likely within the month, so it's high time for me to ensure the paper
is accessible to readers.

The obvious is the cost of accessing a journal. 
Luckily, at least for theoretical physics, math, and stats, we have the wonderful <a href="https://arxiv.org/">ArXiV</a>, where we post all of our preprints, and typically I update with edits as well.
All my papers are here and completely free to access!
There is a _slight_ risk with ArXiV posts, namely that they might not have all edits as the published version has, as these are pre-prints, but generally 
speaking people are responsible to not include anything wrong in their ArXiV posts.

The next would be disability considerations for people with visual disabilities.
I'm going to focus on this one because papers are a visual media first and foremost, you do have to read.
There are two major categories which come to mind: color and readability.
The latter is, unfortunately, out of my control, as most websites which publish papers require a certain format and certain fonts. 
This makes it entirely impossible for me to space documents for accessibility, and it doesn't allow me to pick fonts which help readers with 
dyslexia. 
The prior, however, is certainly something that I can adjust, and that was the bulk of the work I did today: adjusting figures for colorblind readers.

Let's start with the pre-color adjusted case, below.
Forgive all the weird resolution of the images, they're screenshots and so aren't vectorized - I only used vectorized plots in my figures, so that they look crisp and pristine.
Here I have a chunk of my figure with three colors which I picked earlier as a combination of 1) ease of coding it up and 2) easy for _me personally_ to extract details from.
Apart from it being horrendously ugly, there are pairs of colors which are entirely indistinguishable under certain types of colorblindness.
I used the website <a href="https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/">color-blindness.com</a>, which has a great simulation tool that lets you view, to a reasonable level of approximation, images under various generic types of colorblindness.

In the next columns of the figure, I've adjusted the color to emulate four additional cases.
You can see very clearly that for all three of the major color-blindnesses, in this case red-, green-, and blue-blind colloquially, that there are 
pairs of colors which are basically indistinguishable.
There is also the case of achromastopia, which has a dual reason to fix: first, of course, for people with this condition the figure is 100% useless.
Second, many people do not have a color printer or prefer black-white documents.
Nonetheless, the choices I've made in these figures make them entirely unintelligible for people with colorblindness, which is certainly unacceptable.
Let's fix that.

Here's the post-color adjust.
Before I get into the details, let's look at the differences.
For any of the three major color-blindnesses, we still have three entirely distinct colors - great!
Even for black-white vision, the hatching (patterns in the squares) allows us to tell the three different squares apart very clearly.

Now for the details.
In matplotlib, really the only things that you need to do are use a correct colorblind color scheme, and put some hatching in boxes.
Hatching is super easy, look at the style reference <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.5.0/gallery/shapes_and_collections/hatch_style_reference.html"> here </a>.
The color scheme that I used is called <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/lib/matplotlib/mpl-data/stylelib/tableau-colorblind10.mplstyle">tableau-colorbind10</a> and can be used like any other color scheme in matplotlib.
Voila, in just two easy steps you've made your figures accessible to a lot more people than before.
