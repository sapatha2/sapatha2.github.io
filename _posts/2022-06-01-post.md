Following up on <a href="https://sapatha2.github.io/2022/05/31/post.html">yesterday's post</a>, I was thinking about how I would block encode 
a QFT Hamiltonian. 
Turns out that there might be some easy machinery for this, because of the sparsity of the QFT Hamiltonian.
I spent some time today proving the sparsity (see image), which I'll describe in some amount of detail below.
With the sparsity proven, we can pretty easily construct a block encoding using results from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01838"> this paper </a>.

Let's talk sparsity.
Consider a Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} = (\partial_\mu \phi)^2/2 - H_\phi(\phi)$, where $H_phi$ depends only on the field $\phi$ and not the conjugate momentum $\pi,$ and typically has a mass term, interaction, etc. 
The corresponding Hamiltonian, after canonical quantization, looks like this: $\hat{H} = \int d^3x \hat{\pi}^2/2 + H_\phi(\hat{\phi})$.
Note here that the classical fields have been lifted to operators, with the "hat" notation.

Consider now the basis $|\tilde{\phi}\rangle$, which has a very specific behavior under the field operator: $\hat{\phi}(\vec{x})|\tilde{\phi}\rangle = \phi(\vec{x})|\tilde{\phi}\rangle$.
Namely, the basis state $|\tilde{\phi}\rangle$ corresponds to a wave function that has probability exactly 1 for the field to have configuration $\tilde{\phi}(\vec{x})$ - this is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_functional"> Schrodinger representation </a> of quantum field theory states.
Note the right hand side is multiplied by a FUNCTION $\phi(\vec{x})$, not the operator $\hat{\phi}(\vec{x})$; this is important and shows up a bunch later.
In lattice QFT, these constitute our computational basis states, but of course are discritized: $|\tilde{\phi}\rangle \rightarrow |\tilde{\phi}_1 ... \tilde{\phi}_V \rangle$ where V is the number of lattice sites.

We can now consider the Hamiltonian in this computational basis, and get something pretty straight forwards. 
For the $H_{\phi}$ term, since this term depends only on the field, we just $\langle \tilde{\phi}^\prime | H_{\phi}(\hat{\phi}) |\tilde{\phi}\rangle = \delta \[\phi - \phi^\prime\] H_{\phi}(\phi),$ namely this term is diagonal in the computational basis.
Note here that $\delta \[ \cdot \]$ is a functional delta distribution, and it behaves how you'd expect.

The kinetic energy term is a little more complicated.
For this, we will go to the basis $|\tilde{\pi}\rangle$ which is the fourier transform dual to $|\tilde{\phi}\rangle$, and is the diagonal basis for the operators $\hat{\pi}$.
Im going to abuse notation by interchanging between the lattice and continuum notation when it's convenient, sorry.
$\langle \phi^\prime | \int dx \hat{\pi}(x)^2 | \phi \rangle$ = $\int dx d\pi^\prime d\pi e^{i\int d^3z \pi \phi}e^{-i\int d^3z \pi^\prime \phi^\prime}\langle \pi^\prime | \hat{\pi}(x)^2 | \pi \rangle$ = $\int dx d\pi e^{i\int d^3z \pi(\phi - \phi^\prime)} \pi(x)^2$ $\rightarrow \sum_{i \in V} \Pi_{j \neq i} (\int d\pi_j e^{i\int d^3z \pi_j(\phi_j - \phi_j^\prime)}) \times (\int d\pi_i e^{i\int d^3z \pi_i(\phi_i - \phi_i^\prime)}\pi_i^2)$ = $\sum_{i \in V}\Big(\Pi_{j \neq i}\delta(\phi_j - \phi_j^\prime) \Big) \times \int d\pi_i e^{i\int d^3z \pi_i(\phi_i - \phi_i^\prime)}\pi_i^2.$
This last equality is super helpful, it basically says that two basis states $|\phi\rangle, |\phi^\prime \rangle$ can only be coupled by the FULL Hamiltonian if $\phi, \phi^\prime$ differ from each other AT MOST at one point.

Let's think about the Hamiltonian as a matrix then.
If we have $V$ points in our lattice, and at each point we have $N$ ticks for resolution of the field value, we will have a Hilbert space of dimension
will be $N^V$, meaning our Hamiltonian is a $N^V \times N^V$ object.
The $H_{\phi}$ term will assign a unique value to each element of the diagonal of the Hamiltonian, and becuase of the delta functions above the kinetic energy only leads to $N$ non-zero terms in each column/row.
This is because each basis element can only couple to another if all but one element is the same, and the left over one can have $N$ values.
As such, the full Hamiltonian matrix is N+1-sparse in both row and column.

Why is this useful?
Well, as mentioned above, there is a well known technique to efficiently block encode sparse matrices.
For our Hamiltonian object, since it is quite sparse, with each row/column only having N + 1 out of $N^V$ potential non zero values, we can use 
this technique well.
I won't quote all the details, maybe in a post later this week, but here's the gist of it:
Given the sparsity of our matrix, we can generate a $(N, Vlog N + 3, \epsilon)$ block encoding (extra qubits are $Vlog N + 3$, error is $\epsilon$), with $O(V\log N + log^{2.5}(N/\epsilon))$ 1- and 2-qubit gates and $O(b, log^{2.5}(N/\epsilon))$ more auxiliary qubits.
There are some details about pre-amplifying this to remove subnormalization, but i'll talk about that later maybe.
For now, it's sufficient to know that at least block encoding is POSSIBLE for a standard QFT Hamiltonian.
