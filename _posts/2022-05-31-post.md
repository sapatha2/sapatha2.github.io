I'm looking at an interesting project for accurate computing scattering amplitudes for the scalar $\phi^4$ theory with the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu \phi)^2 - m^2\phi^2 - \lambda \phi^4/4!$ on quantum hardware.
This is motivated by a paper by Jordan, Lee and Preskill that you can check out on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3633">ArXiV</a>, with a shorter version on Science.
Here they demonstrate most of the basic principles for computing the scatter amplitude, in a three step process: initial state prep, time evolution, and then measurement.
The main point of interest for me is the initial state preparation, where they prepare the exact $\lambda \neq 0$ vacuum state with two separate, localized, single particle states with well-defined momentum by preparing a similar state with $\lambda = 0$ and adiabatically connecting it by slowly increasing $\lambda$ to the desired value.

I am particularly interested in a different technique for the state preparation, using a method called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02685"> quantum signal processing </a>(QSP). 
The premise here would be to prepare the vacuum of the interacting theory $|\Omega\rangle$ using QSP, and then building the wave packets directly on top of the vacuum.
Turns out, Jordan actually has a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00454">paper</a> exactly about the second step.
The task for today was to understand this paper by Jordan, and get a grasp on the technical details of the classical sources.

It took me about 10 pages of notes to get through it (check left). 
Essentially, a static potential $J_2(\vec{x})$ sets up a sequence of bound states, the ground state of which is the localized scattering state we want. 
A dynamic potential $J_1(\vec{x}, t)$ is then used to adiabatically connect the interacting vacuum $|\Omega\rangle$ to the localized scattering state $|\Psi_0\rangle$ with some accuracy $\epsilon$ using the technique he's coined: "adiabatic passage."
The benefit of this technique over something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_problem"> Rabbi oscillations </a> is the adiabatic approach doesn't require detailed spectral information to get high accuracies (low $\epsilon$.)

With all that info understood, building a two particle scattering state with QSP is conceptually straightforwards:
<ol>
<li> Prepare an initial guess state, probably the non-interacting vacuum $|0\rangle$ which is "easy" to do (or at least we know how to, it's just Gaussian the field strength) </li>

<li> Use QSP to boost the non-interacting vacuum to the interacting one with a potential error $\epsilon_{QSP}$: $|0\rangle \rightarrow |\Omega \rangle + \epsilon_{QSP}$</li>

<li>  Use adiabatic passage to create two localized wave packets on $|\Psi_1, \Psi_2\rangle + \epsilon + \epsilon_{QSP}$.</li>
</ol> 

Now what about the costs of each of these in terms of gates (especially really expensive gates, like T-gates).
I tried to do a bit today, but didn't get far enough before it was time for dinner. 
The Jordan-Lee-Preskill Science paper above has the exact cost for the initial state preparation, so I won't repeat that.
Directly from Jordan's BQP paper, the cost of adiabatic passage is $n$ applications of the unitaries $e^{iH_{\pi}}, e^{iH_{\phi}}$, where $n = O((TV)^{(1 + 1/2k)}/\epsilon^{1/2k})$, $T$ is the total simulation time and goes like $1/\epsilon^8$, $V$ is the discretized lattice volume, $k$ is the level of Trotter expansion, and $\epsilon$ is the final error that you're okay with in the construction of the exact ground state of the interacting field + static potential $J_2(\vec{x})$.
The applications of $e^{iH_{\phi}}, e^{iH_{\pi}}$ also are pretty easy, because they're just sums over scalar quantities for any given field configuration (read basis function).
As for QSP, I have proofs that tell us how expensive a calculation would be if we care for error $\epsilon$, but it depends on the implementation of the Hamiltonian block-encoding.

I don't have ANY sense of how to block-encode the field theory Hamiltonian right now, and that's really the next big step in this project.
If it turns out that the block-encoding is reasonable, then I would just do the cost analysis for steps 1, 2, 3 more carefully, likely in T-counts or
Toffoli counts.
With that, we would be able to explicitly see how expensive preparing the scattering state would be using QSP, and we could compare the cost
relative to the adiabatic technique that Jordan-Lee-Preskill originally posited.
I should also mention that QSP has some extra benefits, like being able to construct vacuua which aren't adiabatically connected to non-interacting ones,
such as when you have spontaneous symmetry breaking. 
I'm not entirely sure that the adiabatic passage technique would work in the strong coupling regime, but that's something to think about as well, 
at least as a nice conceptual bow to tie.
